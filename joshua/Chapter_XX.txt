CHAP. XX.
This short chapter is concerning the cities of refuge, which we often read of in the
writings of Moses, but this is the last time that we find mention of them, for now that matter
was thoroughly settled. Here is, I. The law God gave concerning them, ver. 1-6. II. The
people's designation of the particular cities for that use, ver. 7-9. And this remedial law was
a figure of good things to come.
The Cities of Refuge. (b. c. 1444.)
1 The Lord also spake unto Joshua, saying,   2 Speak to the children of Israel, saying,
Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:   3
That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they
shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.   4 And when he that doth flee unto one of
those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in
the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him
a place, that he may dwell among them.   5 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him,
then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour un-
wittingly, and hated him not beforetime.   6 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand
before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in
those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house,
unto the city from whence he fled.
Many things were by the law of Moses ordered to be done when they came to Canaan
and this among the rest, the appointing of sanctuaries for the protecting of those that were
guilty of casual murder, which was a privilege to all Israel, since no man could be sure but
some time or other it might be his own case; and it was for the interest of the land that the
blood of an innocent person, whose hand only was guilty but not his heart, should not be
shed, no, not by the avenger of blood: of this law, which was so much for their advantage,
God here reminds them, that they might remind themselves of the other laws he had given
them, which concerned his honour. 1. Orders are given for the appointing of these cities (v.
2), and very seasonably at this time when the land was newly surveyed, and so they were
the better able to divide the coasts of it into three parts, as God had directed them, in order
to the more convenient situation of these cities of refuge, Deut. xix. 3. Yet it is probable that
it was not done till after the Levites had their portion assigned them in the next chapter,
because the cities of refuge were all to be Levites' cities. As soon as ever God had given them
cities of rest, he bade them appoint cities of refuge, to which none of them knew but they
might be glad to escape. Thus God provided, not only for their ease at all times, but for their
safety in times of danger, and such times we must expect and prepare for in this world. And
it intimates what God's spiritual Israel have and shall have, in Christ and heaven, not only
171

rest to repose themselves in, but refuge to secure themselves in. And we cannot think these
cities of refuge would have been so often and so much spoken of in the law of Moses, and
have had so much care taken about them (when the intention of them might have been ef-
fectually answered, as it is in our law, by authorizing the courts of judgment to protect and
acquit the manslayer in all those cases wherein he was to have privilege of sanctuary), if they
were not designed to typify the relief which the gospel provides for poor penitent sinners,
and their protection from the curse of the law and the wrath of God, in our Lord Jesus, to
whom believers flee for refuge (Heb. vi. 18), and in whom they are found (Phil. iii. 9) as in
a sanctuary, where they are privileged from arrests, and there is now no condemnation to
them, Rom. viii. 1. 2. Instructions are given for the using of these cities. The laws in this
matter we had before, Num. xxxv. 10, &c., where they were opened at large. (1.) It is supposed
that a man might possibly kill a person, it might be his own child or dearest friend, unawares
and unwittingly (v. 3), not only whom he hated not, but whom he truly loved beforetime
(v. 5); for the way of man is not in himself. What reason have we to thank God who has kept
us both from slaying and from being slain by accident! In this case, it is supposed that the
relations of the person slain would demand the life of the slayer, as a satisfaction to that
ancient law that whoso sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. (2.) It is provided
that if upon trial it appeared that the murder was done purely by accident, and not by design,
either upon an old grudge or a sudden passion, then the slayer should be sheltered from the
avenger of blood in any one of these cities, v. 4-6. By this law he was entitled to a dwelling
in that city, was taken into the care of the government of it, but was confined to it, as pris-
oner at large; only, if he survived the high priest, then, and not till then, he might return to
his own city. And the Jews say, "If he died before the high priest in the city of his refuge and
exile, and was buried there, yet, at the death of the high priest, his bones should be removed
with respect to the place of his fathers' sepulchres."
  7 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount
Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.   8 And on the
other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain
out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in
Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.   9 These were the cities appointed for all the children
of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person
at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he
stood before the congregation.
We have here the nomination of the cities of refuge in the land of Canaan, which was
made by the advice and authority of Joshua and the princes (v. 7); and upon occasion of the
mention of this is repeated the nomination of the other three in the lot of the other two
tribes and a half, which was made by Moses (Deut. iv. 43), but (as bishop Patrick thinks)
they had not the privilege till now. 1. They are said to sanctify these cities, that is the original
172
Chapter XX
word for appointed, v. 7. Not that any ceremony was used to signify the consecration of
them, only they did by a public act of court solemnly declare them cities of refuge, and as
such sacred to the honour of God, as the protector of exposed innocency. If they were
sanctuaries, it was proper to say they were sanctified. Christ, our refuge, was sanctified by
his Father; nay, for our sakes he sanctified himself, John xvii. 19. 2. These cities (as those
also on the other side Jordan) stood in the three several parts of the country, so conveniently
that a man might (they say) in half a day reach some one of them from any corner of the
country. Kedesh was in Naphtali, the most northern tribe, Hebron in Judah, the most
southern, and Shechem in Ephraim, which lay in the middle, about equally distant from the
other two. God is a refuge at hand. 3. They were all Levites' cities, which put an honour
upon God's tribe, making them judges in those cases wherein divine Providence was so
nearly concerned, and protectors to oppressed innocency. It was also a kindness to the poor
refugee, that when he might not go up to the house of the Lord, nor tread his courts, yet he
had the servants of God's house with him, to instruct him, and pray for him, and help to
make up the want of public ordinances. If he must be confined, it shall be to a Levite-city,
where he may, if he will, improve his time. 4. These cities were upon hills to be seen afar
off, for a city on a hill cannot be hid; and this would both direct and encourage the poor
distressed man that was making that way; and, though therefore his way at last was up-hill,
yet this would comfort him, that he would be in his place of safety quickly, and if he could
but get into the suburbs of the city he was well enough off. 5. Some observe a significancy
in the names of these cities with application to Christ our refuge. I delight not in quibbling
upon names, yet am willing to take notice of these. Kedesh signifies holy, and our refuge is
the holy Jesus. Shechem, a shoulder, and the government is upon his shoulder. Hebron, fel-
lowship, and believers are called into the fellowship of Christ Jesus our Lord. Bezer, a forti-
fication, for he is a strong-hold to all those that trust in him. Ramoth, high or exalted, for
him hath God exalted with his own right hand. Golan, joy or exultation, for in him all the
saints are justified, and shall glory. Lastly, Besides all these, the horns of the altar, wherever
it was, were a refuge to those who took hold of them, if the crime were such as that sanctuary
allowed. This is implied in that law (Exod. xxi. 14), that a wilful murderer shall be taken
from God's altar to be put to death. And we find the altar used for this purpose. 1 Kings i.
50; ii. 28. Christ is our altar, who not only sanctifies the gift, but protects the giver.
