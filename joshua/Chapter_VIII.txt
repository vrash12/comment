CHAP. VIII.
The embarrassment which Achan's sin gave to the affairs of Israel being over, we have
them here in a very good posture again, the affairs both of war and religion. Here is, I. The
glorious progress of their arms in the taking of Ai, before which they had lately suffered
disgrace. 1. God encourages Joshua to attack it, with the assurance of success, and directs
him what method to take, ver. 1, 2. 2. Joshua gives orders accordingly to the men of war,
ver. 3-8. 3. The stratagem is managed as it was projected, and succeeds as it was desired,
ver. 9-22. 4. Joshua becomes master of this city, puts all the inhabitants to the sword, burns
it, hangs the king, but gives the plunder to the soldiers, ver. 23-29. II. The great solemnity
of writing and reading the law before a general assembly of all Israel, drawn up for that
purpose upon the two mountains of Gerizim and Ebal, according to an order which Moses
had received from the Lord, and delivered to them, ver. 30-35. Thus did they take their work
before them, and make the business of their religion to keep pace with their secular business.
The Destruction of Ai. (b. c. 1451.)
1 And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people
of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and
his people, and his city, and his land:   2 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst
unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a
prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
Israel were very happy in having such a commander as Joshua, but Joshua was more
happy in having such a director as God himself; when any difficulty occurred, he needed
not to call a council of war who had God so nigh unto him, not only to answer, but even to
anticipate, his enquiries. It should seem, Joshua was now at a stand, had scarcely recovered
the discomposure he was put into by the trouble Achan gave them, and could not think,
without fear and trembling, of pushing forward, lest there should be in the camp another
Achan; then God spoke to him, either by vision, as before (ch. v.), or by the breastplate of
judgment. Note, When we have faithfully put away sin, that accursed thing, which separates
between us and God, then, and not till then, we may expect to hear from God to our comfort;
and God's directing us how to go on in our Christian work and warfare is a good evidence
of his being reconciled to us. Observe here,
I. The encouragement God gives to Joshua to proceed: Fear not, neither be thou dismayed,
v. 1. This intimates that the sin of Achan, and the consequences of it, had been a very great
discouragement to Joshua, and made his heart almost ready to fail. Corruptions within the
church weaken the hands, and damp the spirits, of her guides and helpers, more than oppos-
itions from without; treacherous Israelites are to be dreaded more than malicious Canaanites.
But God bids Joshua not be dismayed; the same power that keeps Israel from being ruined
83
Chapter VIII
by their enemies shall keep them from ruining themselves. To animate him, 1. He assures
him of success against Ai, tells him it is all his own; but he must take it as God's gift: I have
given it into thy hands, which secured him both title and possession, and obliged him to
give God the glory of both, Ps. xliv. 3. 2. He allows the people to take the spoil to themselves.
Here the spoil was not consecrated to God as that of Jericho, and therefore there was no
danger of the people's committing such a trespass as they had committed there. Observe,
How Achan who caught at forbidden spoil lost that, and life, and all, but the rest of the
people who had conscientiously refrained from the accursed thing were quickly recompensed
for their obedience with the spoil of Ai. The way to have the comfort of what God allows
us is to forbear what he forbids us. No man shall lose by his self-denial; let God have his
dues first, and then all will be clean to us and sure, 1 Kings xvii. 13. God did not bring them
to these goodly cities, and houses filled with all good things, to tantalize them with the sight
of that which they might not touch; but, having received the first-fruits from Jericho, the
spoil of Ai, and of all the cities which thenceforward came into their hands, they might take
for a prey to themselves.
II. The direction he gives him in attacking Ai. It must not be such a work of time as the
taking of Jericho was; this would have prolonged the war too much. Those that had patiently
waited seven days for Jericho shall have Ai given them in one day. Nor was it, as that, to be
taken by miracle, and purely by the act of God, but now their own conduct and courage
must be exercised; having seen God work for them, they must now bestir themselves. God
directs him, 1. To take all the people, that they might all be spectators of the action and
sharers in the spoil. Hereby God gave him a tacit rebuke for sending so small a detachment
against Ai in the former attempt upon it, ch. vii. 4. 2. To lay an ambush behind the city; this
was a method which perhaps Joshua would not have thought of at this time, if God had not
directed him to it; and though now we are not to expect direction, as here, by visions, voices,
or oracles, yet, whenever those who are entrusted with public councils take prudent measures
for the public good, it must be acknowledged that God puts it into their hearts; he that
teaches the husbandman discretion no doubt teaches statesman and general.
3 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out
thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.   4 And he commanded
them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very
far from the city, but be ye all ready:   5 And I, and all the people that are with me, will ap-
proach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first,
that we will flee before them,   6 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them
from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before
them.   7 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the Lord your
God will deliver it into your hand.   8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye
shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do. See, I have
84
Chapter VIII
commanded you.   9 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and
abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among
the people.   10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and
went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.   11 And all the people, even
the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and
pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.   12 And he
took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the
west side of the city.   13 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the
north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into
the midst of the valley.   14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted
and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his
people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush
against him behind the city.   15 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.   16 And all the people that were in Ai were
called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away
from the city.   17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel:
and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.   18 And the Lord said unto Joshua,
Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And
Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.   19 And the ambush
arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and
they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.   20 And when the
men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to
heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the
wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.   21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the
ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,
and slew the men of Ai.   22 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were
in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so
that they let none of them remain or escape.
We have here an account of the taking of Ai by stratagem. The stratagem here used, we
are sure, was lawful and good; God himself appointed it, and we have no reason to think
but that the like is lawful and good in other wars. Here was no league broken, no treaty of
peace, that the advantage was gained; no, these are sacred things, and not to be jested with,
nor used to serve a turn; truth, when once it is plighted, becomes a debt even to the enemy.
But in this stratagem here was no untruth told; nothing was concealed but their own counsels,
which no enemy ever pretended a right to be entrusted with; nothing was dissembled,
nothing counterfeited but a retreat, which was no natural or necessary indication at all of
their inability to maintain their onset, or of any design not to renew it. The enemy ought to
have been upon their guard, and to have kept within the defence of their own walls. Common
85
Chapter VIII
prudence, had they been governed by it, would have directed them not to venture on the
pursuit of an army which they saw was so far superior to them in numbers, and leave their
city unguarded; but (si populus vult decipi, decipiatur—if the people will be deceived, let them)
if the Canaanites will be so easily imposed upon, and in pursuit of God's Israel will break
through all the laws of policy and good management, the Israelites are not at all to be blamed
for taking advantage of their fury and thoughtlessness; nor is it any way inconsistent with
the character God is pleased to give of them, that they are children that will not lie. Now in
the account here given of this matter,
I. There is some difficulty in adjusting the numbers that were employed to effect it.
Mention is made (v. 3) of 30,000 that were chosen and sent away by night, to whom the
charge was given to surprise the city as soon as ever they perceived it was evacuated, v. 4, 7,
8. And yet afterwards (v. 12) it is said, Joshua took 5000 men and set them to lie in ambush
behind the city, and that ambush entered the city, and set it on fire, v. 19. Now, 1. Some think
there were two parties sent out to lie in ambush, 30,000 first, and afterwards 5000 to guard
the roads, and to intercept those that were first sent out; and that Joshua made his open attack
upon the city with all the thousands of Israel. So the learned bishop Patrick, insisting upon
God's command (v. 1) to take all the people of war with him. But, 2. Others think that all the
people were taken only to encamp before the city, and that out of them Joshua chose out
30,000 men to be employed in the action, out of which he sent out 5000 to lie in ambush,
which were as many as could be supposed to march incognito—without being discovered
(more would have been seen, and thus the design would have been broken) and that then
with the other 25,000 he made the open attack, as Masius thinks, or with the 30,000, which,
as Calvin thinks, he kept entire for that purpose, having, besides them, sent out 5000 for an
ambuscade. And those 5000 (they think) must be meant by those (v. 3) whom he sent away
by night, with orders to lie in wait behind the city, though the particular number is not
specified till v. 12. If we admit such a seeming disturbance in the order of the narrative (of
which, perhaps, similar instances might be cited from the other scripture histories), it seems
most probable that there was but one ambushment, which consisted only of 5000, enough
for such a purpose.
II. Yet the principal parts of the story are plain enough, that a detachment being secretly
marched behind the city, on the other side to that on which the main body of the army lay
(the situation of the country, it is probable, favouring their concealment), Joshua, and the
forces with him, faced the city; the garrison made a vigorous sally out upon them, whereupon
they withdrew, gave ground, and retreated in some seeming disorder towards the wilderness,
which being perceived by the men of Ai, they drew out all the force they had to pursue them.
This gave a fair opportunity for those that lay in ambush to make themselves masters of the
city, whereof when they had given notice by a smoke to Joshua, he, with all his force, returned
upon the pursuers, who now, when it was too late, were aware of the snare they were drawn
86
Chapter VIII
into, and, their retreat being intercepted, they were every man of them cut off. The like artifice
we find used, Judg. xx. 30, &c. Now in this story we may observe,
1. What a brave commander Joshua was. See, (1.) His conduct and prudence. God gave
him the hint (v. 2) that he should lay an ambush behind the city, but left him to himself to
order the particulars, which he did admirably well. Doubtless wisdom strengthens the wise
more than ten mighty men, Eccl. vii. 19. (2.) His care and industry (v. 10): He rose up early
in the morning, that he might lose no time, and to show how intent his mind was upon his
business. Those that would maintain their spiritual conflicts must not love their ease. (3.)
His courage and resolution; though an army of Israelites had been repulsed before Ai, yet
he resolves to lead them on in person the second time, v. 5. Being himself also an elder, he
took the elders of Israel with him to make this attack upon the city (v. 10), as if he were going
rather to sit in judgment upon them as criminals than to fight them as enemies. (4.) His
caution and consideration (v. 13): He went that night into the midst of the valley, to make
the necessary dispositions for an attack, and to see that every thing was in good order. It is
the pious conjecture of the learned bishop Patrick that he went into the valley alone, to pray
to God for a blessing upon his enterprise, and he did not seek in vain. (5.) His constancy
and perseverance; when he had stretched out his spear towards the city (v. 18, a spear almost
as fatal and formidable to the enemies of Israel as the rod of Moses was) he never drew back
his hand till the work was done. His hands in fighting, like Moses's in interceding, were
steady till the going down of the sun. Those that have stretched out their hands against their
spiritual enemies must never draw them back. Lastly, What Joshua did in the stratagem is
applicable to our Lord Jesus, of whom he was a type. Joshua conquered by yielding, as if he
had himself been conquered; so our Lord Jesus, when he bowed his head and gave up the
ghost, seemed as if death had triumphed over him, and as if he and all his interests had been
routed and ruined; but in his resurrection he rallied again and gave the powers of darkness
a total defeat; he broke the serpent's head, by suffering him to bruise his heel. A glorious
stratagem!
2. What an obedient people Israel was. What Joshua commanded them to do, according
to the commandment of the Lord (v. 8), they did it without murmuring or disputing. Those
that were sent to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai (two cities confederate against them)
were in a post of danger, and had they been discovered might all have been cut off, and yet
they ventured; and, when the body of the army retreated and fled, it was both disgraceful
and perilous, and yet, in obedience to Joshua, they did it.
3. What an infatuated enemy the king of Ai was, (1.) That he did not by his scouts dis-
cover those that lay in ambush behind the city, v. 14. Some observe it as a remarkable instance
of the power of God in making men blind to their own interest, and the things that belong
to their peace, that he wist not that there were liers in wait against him. Those are most in
danger who are least aware that they are so. (2.) That when Israel seemed to fly he drew out
87
Chapter VIII
all his forces to pursue them, and left none to guard his city and to secure his retreat, v. 17.
Thus the church's enemies often run themselves into destruction by their own fury and the
violence of their rage against the Israel of God. Pharaoh plunged himself into the Red Sea
by the eagerness with which he pursued Israel. (3.) That from the killing of thirty-six men
out of 3000, when Israel made the former attack upon his city, he should infer the total
routing of so great an army as now he had to deal with (v. 6): They flee before us as at the
first. See how the prosperity of fools destroys them and hardens them to their ruin. God had
made use of the men of Ai as a scourge to chastise his people for meddling with the accursed
thing, and this had puffed them up with a conceit that they must have the honour of deliv-
ering their country from these formidable invaders; but they were soon made to see their
mistake, and that when the Israelites had reconciled themselves to their God they could
have no power against them. God had made use of them only for the rebuking of Israel,
with a purpose, when the correction was over, to throw the rod itself into the fire; howbeit,
they meant not so, but it was in their heart to destroy and cut off, Isa. x. 5-7.
4. What a complete victory Israel obtained over them by the favour and blessing of God.
Each did his part: the divided forces of Israel, by signals agreed on, understood one another,
and every thing succeeded according to the project; so that the men of Ai, even when they
were most confident of victory, found themselves surrounded, so that they had neither
spirit to resist nor room to fly, but were under a fatal necessity of yielding their lives to the
destroyers. And now it is hard to say whether the shouts of the men of Israel, or the shrieks
of the men of Ai, were the louder, but easy to imagine what terror and confusion they were
filled with, when their highest assurances sunk so suddenly into the heaviest despair. Note,
The triumphing of the wicked is short, Job xx. 5. They are exalted for a little while, that their
fall and ruin may be the sorer, Job xxiv. 24. See how easily, how quickly, the scale turns
against those that have not God on their side.
23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.   24 And it came to
pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the
wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword,
until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge
of the sword.   25 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were
twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.   26 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith
he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.   27 Only
the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto
the word of the Lord which he commanded Joshua.   28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it
a heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.   29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree
until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take
his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise
thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.
88
Chapter VIII
We have here an account of the improvement which the Israelites made of their victory
over Ai. 1. They put all to the sword, not only in the field, but in the city, man, woman, and
child, none of them remained, v. 24. God, the righteous Judge, had passed this sentence
upon them for their wickedness, so that the Israelites were only the ministers of his justice
and the executioners of his doom. Once in this story, and but once, mention is made of the
men of Beth-el, as confederates with the men of Ai, v. 17. Though they had a king of their
own, and were not subjects to the king of Ai (for the king of Beth-el is reckoned among the
thirty-one kings that Joshua destroyed, ch. xii. 16), yet Ai being a stronger place they threw
themselves into that, for their own safety, and the strengthening of their neighbours' hands,
and so (we may presume) were all cut off with them; thus that by which they hoped to prevent
their own ruin hastened it. The whole number of the slain, it seems, was but 12,000, and
inconsiderable body to make head against all the thousands of Israel; but those whom God
will destroy he infatuates. Here it is said (v. 26) that Joshua drew not his hand back wherewith
he stretched out the spear (v. 18) till the slaughter was completed. Some think the spear he
stretched out was not to slay the enemies, but to animate and encourage his own soldiers,
some flag or ensign being hung out at the end of this spear; and they observe it as an instance
of his self-denial that though the fire of courage wherewith his breast was filled would have
pushed him forward, sword in hand, into the hottest of the action, yet, in obedience to God,
he kept the inferior post of a standard-bearer, and did not quit it till the work was done. By
the spear stretched out, he directed the people to expect their help from God, and to him
to give the praise. 2. They plundered the city and took all the spoil to themselves, v. 27. Thus
the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just; the spoil they brought out of Egypt, by bor-
rowing of their neighbours, was much of it expended upon the tabernacle they had reared
in the wilderness, for which they are now reimbursed with interest. The spoil here taken, it
is probable, was all brought together, and distributed by Joshua in due proportions, as that
of the Midianites was, Num. xxxi. 26, &c. It was not seized with irregularity or violence, for
God is the God of order and equity, and not of confusion. 3. They laid the city in ashes, and
left it to remain so, v. 28. Israel must yet dwell in tents, and therefore this city, as well as
Jericho, must be burnt. And, though there was no curse entailed upon him that should rebuild
it, yet, it seems, it was not rebuilt unless it be the same with Aijah, which we read of, long
after, Neh. xi. 31. Some think it was not rebuilt because Israel had received a defeat before
it, the remembrance of which should be buried in the ruins of the city. 4. The king of Ai was
taken prisoner and cut off, not by the sword of war as a soldier, but by the sword of justice
as a malefactor. Joshua ordered him to be hanged, and his dead body thrown at the gate of
his own city, under a heap of stone, v. 23, 29. Some particular reason, no doubt, there was
for this severity against the king of Ai; it is likely he had been notoriously wicked and vile,
and a blasphemer of the God of Israel, perhaps upon occasion of the repulse he had given
to the forces of Israel in their first onset. Some observe that his dead body was thrown at
89
Chapter VIII
the gate where he had been wont to sit in judgment that so much the greater contempt might
thereby be poured upon the dignity he had been proud of, and he might be punished for
the unrighteous decrees he had made in the very place where he had made them. Thus the
Lord is known by the judgments which he executes.
Sacrifice Offered on Mount Ebal; The Reading of the Law. (b. c. 1451.)
30 Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in mount Ebal,   31 As Moses
the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the
law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they
offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings.   32 And he
wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of
the children of Israel.   33 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,
stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark
of the covenant of the Lord, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of
them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the
servant of the Lord had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.   34
And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all
that is written in the book of the law.   35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded,
which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little
ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.
This religious solemnity of which we have here an account comes in somewhat surpris-
ingly in the midst of the history of the wars of Canaan. After the taking of Jericho and Ai,
we should have expected that the next news would be of their taking possession of the
country, the pushing on of their victories in other cities, and the carrying of the war into
the bowels of the nation, now that they had made themselves masters of these frontier towns.
But here a scene opens of quite another nature; the camp of Israel is drawn out into the
field, not to engage the enemy, but to offer sacrifice, to hear the law read, and to say Amen
to the blessings and the curses. Some think this was not done till after some of the following
victories were obtained which were read of, ch. x. and xi. But it should seem by the maps
that Shechem (near to which these two mountains Gerizim and Ebal were) was not so far
off from Ai but that when they had taken that they might penetrate into the country as far
as those two mountains, and therefore I would not willingly admit a transposition of the
story; and the rather because, as it comes in here, it is a remarkable instance, 1. Of the zeal
of Israel for the service of God and for his honour. Though never was war more honourable,
more pleasant, or more gainful, nor ever was war more sure of victory, or more necessary
to a settlement (for they had neither houses nor lands of their own till they had won them
by the sword, no, not Joshua himself), yet all the business of the war shall stand still, while
they make a long march to the place appointed, and there attend this solemnity. God appoin-
ted them to do this when they should have got over Jordan, and they did it as soon as possibly
90
Chapter VIII
they could, though they might have had a colourable pretence to put it off. Note, We must
not think to defer our covenanting with God till we are settled in the world, or must any
business put us by from minding and pursuing the one thing needful. The way to prosper
is to begin with God, Matt. vi. 33. 2. It is an instance of the care of God concerning his
faithful servants and worshippers. Though they were in an enemy's country, as yet un-
conquered, yet in the service of God they were safe, as Jacob when in this very country he
was going to Beth-el to pay his vows: the terror of God was upon the cities round about, Gen.
xxxv. 5. Note, When we are in the way of duty God takes us under his special protection.
Twice Moses had given express orders for this solemnity; once Deut. xi. 29, 30, where
he seems to have pointed to the very place where it was to be performed; and again Deut.
xxvii. 2, &c. It was a federal transaction: the covenant was now renewed between God and
Israel upon their taking possession of the land of promise, that they might be encouraged
in the conquest of it, and might know upon what terms they held it, and come under fresh
obligations to obedience. In token of the covenant,
I. They built an altar, and offered sacrifice to God (v. 30, 31), in token of their dedication
of themselves to God, as living sacrifices to his honour, in and by a Mediator, who is the
altar that sanctifies this gift. This altar was erected on Mount Ebal, the mount on which the
curse was put (Deut. xi. 29), to signify that there, where by the law we had reason to expect
a curse, by Christ's sacrifice of himself for us and his mediation we have peace with God;
he has redeemed us from the curse of the law by being made a curse for us, Gal. iii. 13. Even
where it was said, by the curse, You are not my people, there it is said, through Christ the
altar, You are the children of the living God, Hos. i. 10. The curses pronounced on Mount
Ebal would immediately have been executed if atonement had not been made by sacrifice.
By the sacrifices offered on this altar they did likewise give God the glory of the victories
they had already obtained, as Exod. xvii. 15. Now that they had had the comfort of them,
in the spoils of Ai, it was fit that God should have the praise of them. And they also implored
his favour for their future success; for supplications as well as thanksgivings were intended
in their peace-offerings. The way to prosper in all that we put our hand to is to take God
along with us, and in all our ways to acknowledge him by prayer, praise, and dependence.
The altar they built was of rough unhewn stone, according to the law (Exod. xx. 25), for that
which is most plain and natural, and least artful and affected, in the worship of God, he is
best pleased with. Man's device can add no beauty to God's institutions.
II. They received the law from God; and this those must do that would find favour with
him, and expect to have their offerings accepted; for, if we turn away our ear from hearing
the law, our prayers will be an abomination. When God took Israel into covenant he gave
them his law, and they, in token of their consent to the covenant, subjected themselves to
the law. Now here,
91
Chapter VIII
1. The law of the ten commandments was written upon stones in the presence of all Israel,
as an abridgment of the whole, v. 32. This copy was not graven in the stone, as that which
was reserved in the ark: That was to be done only by the finger of God; it is his prerogative
to write the law in the heart. But the stones were plastered, and it was written upon the
plaster, Deut. xxvii. 4, 8. It was written, that all might see what it was that they consented
to, and that it might be a standing remaining testimony to posterity of God's goodness in
giving them such good laws, and a testimony against them if they were disobedient to them.
It is a great mercy to any people to have the law of God in writing, and it is fit that the
written law should be exposed to common view in a known tongue, that it may be seen and
read of all men.
2. The blessings and the curses, the sanctions of the law, were publicly read, and the
people (we may suppose), according to Moses's appointment, said Amen to them, v. 33, 34.
(1.) The auditory was very large. [1.] The greatest prince was not excused. The elders,
officers, and judges, are not above the cognizance of the law, but will come under the
blessing or the curse, according as they are or are not obedient to it, and therefore they must
be present to consent to the covenant and to go before the people therein. [2.] The poorest
stranger was not excluded. Here was a general naturalization of them: as well the stranger
as he that was born among them was taken into covenant. This was an encouragement to
proselytes, and a happy presage of the kindnesses intended for the poor Gentiles in the latter
days.
(2.) The tribes were posted, as Moses directed, six towards Gerizim and six towards
Ebal. And the ark in the midst of the valley was between them, for it was the ark of the cov-
enant; and in it were shut up the close rolls of that law which was copied out and shown
openly upon the stones. The covenant was commanded, and the command covenanted.
The priests that attended the ark, or some of the Levites that attended them, after the people
had all taken their places, and silence was proclaimed, pronounced distinctly the blessings
and the curses, as Moses had drawn them up, to which the tribes said Amen; and yet it is
here only said that they should bless the people, for the blessing was that which was first and
chiefly intended, and which God designed in giving the law. If they fell under the curse, that
was their own fault. And it was really a blessing to the people that they had this matter laid
so plainly before them, life and death, good and evil; he had not dealt so with other nations.
3. The law itself also containing the precepts and prohibitions was read (v. 35), it should
seem by Joshua himself, who did not think it below him to be a reader in the congregation
of the Lord. In conformity to this example, the solemn reading of the law, which was appoin-
ted once in seven years (Deut. xxxi. 10, 11), was performed by their king or chief magistrate.
It is here intimated what a general publication of the law this was. (1.) Every word was read;
even the minutest precepts were not omitted, nor the most copious abridged; not one iota
or tittle of the law shall pass away, and therefore none was, in reading, skipped over, under

pretence of want of time, or that any part was needless or not proper to be read. It was not
many weeks since Moses had preached the whole book of Deuteronomy to them, yet Joshua
must now read it all over again; it is good to hear twice what God has spoken once (Ps. lxii.
11) and to review what had been delivered to us, or to have it repeated, that we may not let
it slip. (2.) Every Israelite was present, even the women and the little ones that all might know
and do their duty. Note, Masters of families should bring their wives and children with them
to the solemn assemblies for religious worship. All that are capable of learning must come
to be taught out of the law. The strangers also attended with them; for wherever we are,
though but as strangers, we should improve every opportunity of acquainting ourselves
with God and his holy will.
